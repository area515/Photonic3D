Three easy steps for starting/installing Creation Workshop Host on Raspberry Pi or linux

Do you want to start the latest stable build?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo wget https://github.com/area515/Creation-Workshop-Host/raw/master/host/bin/start.sh
sudo chmod 777 start.sh
sudo ./start.sh

Do you want to start the latest unstable daily development build?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo wget https://github.com/WesGilster/Creation-Workshop-Host/raw/master/host/bin/start.sh
sudo chmod 777 start.sh
sudo ./start.sh WesGilster

Do you want to use your web browser to automatically navigate to the running 
printer host without knowing anything about how your network is setup?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo browseprinter.sh
browseprinter.bat

Common Problems:
----------------
Problem: Right after installing the software and then rebooting the Raspberry Pi, 
		it won't find my displays anymore.
Solution: Make sure your SD card is being "fully used" by choosing the following
		option in your raspi-config "1 Expand Filesystem"

Start script Features:
----------------------
Downloads and starts the latest build of the Creation Workshop Host
Adds ourselves as a service in Linux
Installs the latest version of Java if it isn't at least 1.8
Sets the display variable if it isn't already set
If Creation Workshop Host isn't already installed, it installs it.
Installs rxtx if it isn't already installed

TODO:
-----
Need to make sure the script fails if you aren't root or you aren't sudo'd
