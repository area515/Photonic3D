Three easy steps for starting/installing Creation Workshop Host on Raspberry Pi or linux

Do you want to start the latest stable build?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo wget https://github.com/WesGilster/Creation-Workshop-Host/raw/master/host/bin/start.sh
sudo chmod 777 start.sh
sudo ./start.sh

Do you want to start the latest unstable daily development build?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo wget https://github.com/WesGilster/Creation-Workshop-Host/raw/master/host/bin/startdev.sh
sudo wget https://github.com/WesGilster/Creation-Workshop-Host/raw/master/host/bin/start.sh
sudo chmod 777 startdev.sh
sudo chmod 777 start.sh
sudo ./startdev.sh


Start script Features:
----------------------
Downloads and starts the latest build of the Creation Workshop Host
Adds ourselves as a service in Linux
Installs the latest version of Java if it isn't at least 1.8
Sets the display variable if it isn't already set
If Creation Workshop Host isn't already installed, it installs it.
Installs rxtx if it isn't already installed

TODO:
-----
Need to make sure the script fails if you aren't root or you aren't sudo'd
Need to make sure the script starts and configures and starts xWindows if it hasn't already been started.
